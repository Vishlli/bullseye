Bullseye Guessing Game

ðŸŽ¯ Welcome to Bullseye Guessing Game! ðŸŽ¯
In this game, youâ€™ll be guessing a secret number chosen randomly from a range based on the difficulty level you select. Along the way, you'll get visual hints and fun ASCII art to guide you toward the bullseye! Let's dive into the steps to play the game and some key details you'll need to know.

How to Play:
1.Enter the Level:
oAt the start of the game, youâ€™ll be asked to enter a level.
oThe level determines the range of numbers you'll guess from. For example, if you enter 10, the secret number will be randomly chosen between 1 and 10.
2.Start Guessing:
oOnce the game starts, you need to guess the number.
oAfter each guess, the game will give you a visual hint showing how close or far your guess is to the secret number.
3.Hints and Visual Guide:
oThe game uses ASCII art and arrows (|) to help you understand how close your guess is to the target:
ï‚§Far Away: Your guess is far from the secret number, and the visual will look upset (-_-).
ï‚§Closer but still far (7+ distance): The game will encourage you to aim closer with a hint like "Away! Aim closer."
ï‚§Almost There (less than 7 distance): The visual will indicate you're getting very close.
ï‚§Exact Match: ðŸŽ¯ You hit the Bullseye, and the game will celebrate your victory!
4.Final Score:
oThe game tracks how many guesses you make.
